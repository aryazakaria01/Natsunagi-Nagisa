markdown_help_text: |
      Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. Yuii has some enhancements, to make sure that
      saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.
      - <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
      - <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
      - <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
      - <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>,
      and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
      EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>
      - <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram
      buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code>
      will be the url which is opened.
      EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>
      If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
      <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
      [two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
      This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.
      Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!

      *Chatroom Spam Prediction*
       This feature uses @Intellivoid's Coffeehouse AI to

       it [here](https://docs.intellivoid.net/coffeehouse/v1/nlp/spam_prediction/chatroom)

raid_help: |
   Ever had your group raided by spammers or bots?
   This module allows you to quickly stop the raiders
   By enabling *lockgroup* or *raid* the bot will automatically kick every user that tries to join
   When the raid is done you can toggle back lockgroup and everything will be back to normal.
  
   *Admins only!*

   • /lockgroup `(on/off)` : check and toggle the current lockgroup status
   By enabling *lockgroup* the bot will kick every user on joining the group.
   (for permanent lock - needs to be manually disabled)

   • /raid `(off/time optional)` : toggle the raid mode (on/off)
   if no time is given it will default to 2 hours then turn off automatically

   • /raidtime `(time optional)` : view or set the default duration for raid mode, after that time from toggling the raid mode will turn off automatically
   Default is 6 hours

   • /raidactiontime `(time optional)` : view or set the default duration that the raid mode will tempban
   Default is 1 hour

welcome_mutes: |
   You can get the bot to mute new people who join your group and hence prevent spambots from flooding your group.
   The following options are possible:
   • <code>/welcomemute soft</code><b>:</b> restricts new members from sending media for 24 hours.
   • <code>/welcomemute strong</code><b>:</b> mutes new members till they tap on a button thereby verifying they're human.
   • <code>/welcomemute captcha</code><b>:</b>  mutes new members till they solve a button captcha thereby verifying they're human.
   • <code>/welcomemute off</code><b>:</b> turns off welcomemute.
   <b>Note:</b> Strong mode kicks a user from the chat if they dont verify in 120 seconds. They can always rejoin though

welcome_help: |
   Your group's welcome/goodbye messages can be personalised in multiple ways. If you want the messages
   to be individually generated, like the default welcome message is, you can use *these* variables:
   • <code>{first}</code><b>:</b> this represents the user's *first* name
   • <code>{last}</code><b>:</b> this represents the user's *last* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no 
   last name.
   • <code>{fullname}</code><b>:</b> this represents the user's *full* name. Defaults to *first name* if user has no 
   last name.
   • <code>{username}</code><b>:</b> this represents the user's *username*. Defaults to a *mention* of the user's 
   first name if has no username.
   • <code>{mention}</code><b>:</b> this simply *mentions* a user - tagging them with their first name.
   • <code>{id}</code><b>:</b> this represents the user's *id*
   • <code>{count}</code><b>:</b> this represents the user's *member number*.
   • <code>{chatname}</code><b>:</b> this represents the *current chat name*.
   Each variable MUST be surrounded by <code>{}</code> to be replaced.
   Welcome messages also support markdown, so you can make any elements bold/italic/code/links. 
   Buttons are also supported, so you can make your welcomes look awesome with some nice intro 
   buttons.
   "To create a button linking to your rules, use this: <code>[Rules](buttonurl://t.me/{dispatcher.bot.username}?start=group_id)</code>. 
   Simply replace <code>group_id</code> with your group's id, which can be obtained via /id, and you're good to 
   go. Note that group ids are usually preceded by a <code>-</code> sign; this is required, so please don't 
   remove it.
   You can even set images/gifs/videos/voice messages as the welcome message by 
   replying to the desired media, and calling <code>/setwelcome</code>.
